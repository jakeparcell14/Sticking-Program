The Sticking Helper is a program designed to make adding stickings to music more dynamic and efficient. When adding stickings manually into music software like Sibelius or Finale, composers typically have to enter each note individually. 

How to Use the Sticking Helper

With the Sticking Helper, all you have to do is play the part on your keyboard and let the program type the stickings based on your playing. After playing the part, simply click the Copy All button and paste the sticking into your music software of choice. The letters will automatically be formatted to the desired note.
